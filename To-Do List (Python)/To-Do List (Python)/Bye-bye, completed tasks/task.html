<p>Planning is one thing, but when we need to knuckle down and put our plans into action, we tend to push our tasks back until the very last minute. Or even worse, we often tend to miss the established deadline. It happens even to the best of us! In this stage, let's implement the ability to see the tasks with a missed deadline and delete them.</p>
<p>To delete a row from the table, use the <code class="language-python">delete()</code> method that accepts an object. As you remember, each row is represented by a Python object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import datetime

# delete all rows where the date column is today's date
session.query(Table).filter(Table.date == datetime.today().date()).delete()

# delete a specific row
rows = session.query(Table).filter(Table.date &lt; datetime.today().date()).all()
specific_row = rows[0] # in case rows is not empty
session.delete(specific_row)

# don't forget to commit the changes
session.commit()</code></pre>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Add the following items to your menu:</p>
<ol>
<li><code class="language-python">Missed tasks</code>. It prints all the tasks with a missed deadline. Order the tasks by the deadline date;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">Delete a task</code>. It deletes the chosen task. Print <code class="language-python">Nothing to delete</code> if the tasks list is empty. This menu should also print all the tasks sorted by the deadline date and ask to enter the number for the task.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the Example section for further detail.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
